Selenium tool, Cucumber, TestNG and Slf4j libraries were used in this test automation.
The purpose of TestNG is to create a Dashboard with the Test Listener. TestNG offers the parallel running test.
The purpose of the Cucumber library is to create test scenarios close to colloquial language. These scenarios are transformed into methods.
Slf4j library was used to see detailed log information.
The created dashboard is stored under the /report file according to the date information.
When a scenario failed, it was shown on the dashboard along with a screenshot.
